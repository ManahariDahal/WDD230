                    "Are you getting my texts???" she texted to him. He glanced at it and chuckled under his breath. 
                    Of course he was getting them, but if he wasn't getting them, how would he ever be able to answer? 
                    He put the phone down and continued on his project. He was ignoring her texts and he planned to continue to do so.
                    Barbara had been waiting at the table for twenty minutes. it had been twenty long and excruciating minutes.

                    <br>
                    David had promised that he would be on time today. He never was, but he had promised this one time. 
                    She had made him repeat the promise multiple times over the last week until she'd believed his promise. 
                    Now she was paying the price.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The leather jacked showed the scars of being his favorite for years. It wore those scars with pride, feeling that they enhanced his presence rather than diminishing it. 
                    The scars gave it character and had not overwhelmed to the point that it had become ratty. The jacket was in its prime and it knew it.
                    
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Here's the thing. She doesn't have anything to prove, but she is going to anyway. That's just her character. 
                    She knows she doesn't have to, but she still will just to show you that she can. 
                    Doubt her more and she'll prove she can again. We all already know this and you will too.
